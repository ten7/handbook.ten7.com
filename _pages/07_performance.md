You’re probably wondering, “How will I know if I’m doing a good job and meeting expectations?”

We understand the importance of feedback, and you’ll likely hear a lot of it during your first few weeks on the job. At TEN7, we believe in a pat on the back for a job well done, but we’ll also gently advise if there’s a more efficient way of doing things. Consider it constructive collaboration! Remember, we believe in honesty, and making each other better. Besides ad hoc feedback, we also have the following more structured chats and reviews:

* Regular check-ins with your project lead.
* At least once a month, you’ll have a one-on-one 30-minute Zoom chat with whomever you report to. You can use this time to talk about how your life is going—both at work and at home. Use this opportunity to discuss whatever is on your mind.
* Around your date of hire anniversary each year, you'll have an official annual review with whomever you report to.
