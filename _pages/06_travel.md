## Travel and Expense Policy

TEN7 will reimburse employees for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with approved travel on behalf of the company or for other, approved, work-related expenses. 

Reimbursement is allowed only when reimbursement has not been, and will not be, paid by TEN7. If the work-related event is elective (not required or coordinated by TEN7), please use an appropriate stipend that has been pre-approved to cover any expenses, and request reimbursement via Compt. If the event is required or coordinated by TEN7, please request reimbursement by sending an email with receipts, invoices, folios, and any relevant documentation to receipts@ten7.com. 

If a circumstance arises that isn’t specifically covered in this policy, please reach out to our Director of Operations.

### Expense Reimbursement Process

All expenses must be approved in advance by our Director of Operations.  Requests will not be reimbursed without pre-approval. Travelers should verify that planned travel is eligible for reimbursement before making travel arrangements. Employees are expected to submit their reimbursement request (with scanned receipts) to the Director of Operations no later than 30 days after the expense is incurred. 

### Cancellations/No-Shows

Any cancellations must have prior approval; otherwise employees must reimburse TEN7 for paid expenses. In the case of a travel cancellation, where credit is provided in lieu of a refund, the credit should be transferred to TEN7. The credit may also be paid as cash to TEN7 directly if it is associated with a personal account.

Employees are responsible for any no-shows or otherwise missed transportation (flight, train, etc.) to a work event and must reimburse TEN7 for any associated non-refundable fees for transportation and accommodations (hotels, home stays, etc.). If this happens due to a circumstance out of your control, please talk with our Director of Operations, and we'll work with you to do what's fair.

### Airfare

Travelers are expected to obtain the lowest available airfare that reasonably meets business travel needs and allows you to choose your own seat. Travelers may be asked to book their own flights or in some cases, airfare may be prepaid by TEN7.

Travelers are encouraged to book flights at least 30 days in advance to avoid premium airfare pricing. Coach/economy tickets must be purchased for domestic or international flights. TEN7 will not reimburse for checked baggage or flight upgrades (see Non-reimbursable Expenses below).

If the airfare was not prepaid by TEN7, an original itemized airline receipt, an e-ticket receipt/statement or an Internet receipt/statement is required. The receipt must show the method of payment and indicate that payment was made.

### Rail Transportation

If rail transportation was not prepaid by TEN7, an original itemized receipt, original e-ticket receipt/statement, or Internet receipt/statement is required. The receipt must show the method of payment and indicate that payment was made.

### Rental Vehicles

Reimbursement for a rental vehicle as a primary mode of transportation is authorized only if the rental vehicle is more economical than any other type of public transportation, or if the destination is not otherwise accessible.

TEN7 authorizes reimbursement for the most economic vehicle available. We encourage travelers to purchase collision damage waiver (CDW) and loss damage waiver (LDW) coverage. TEN7 will reimburse the cost of CDW and LDW coverage.  The rental agreement must clearly show the date and the points of departure/arrival, as well as the total cost. Drivers must adhere to the rental requirements, and restrictions must be followed.

Travelers are required to fill the gas tank before returning the vehicle to the rental agency to avoid service fees and more expensive fuel rates.

Original receipts are required.

### Personal Vehicles

Personal vehicle use may be authorized only if it’s more economical compared to other forms of transportation. If you need to park at the airport consider the total costs of mileage/parking fees versus other forms of transportation (taxi or public transit).

Mileage reimbursement is based on the [IRS Standard Business Mileage Rate](https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/standard-mileage-rates) for the most recent year.  This rate covers all expenses associated with the use of a personal vehicle for business purposes.

Travelers can submit driving directions (ie Google Maps) as proof of distance traveled for mileage reimbursement. Document on the driving directions the date the travel took place.  Bridge tolls are a reimbursable expense (no receipts are required).

When using a personal vehicle for business use, employees assume liability for the vehicle.  Employees must have a current, valid driver’s license and vehicle liability insurance in the minimum amounts required by state law.

### Other Transportation

Receipts are required for rideshare, taxi, bus, subway, metro, ferry, and other modes of transportation.

### Parking

Original receipts are required for parking fees (including airport parking). The lodging bill can be used as a receipt when charges are included as part of the overnight stay.

When headed to the airport, consider the more economical choice between taking public transit to/from the airport and your primary worksite or driving a personal vehicle and parking at the airport during extended travel time.

### Lodging

TEN7 will arrange lodging (room rate and tax only) for all employee business travel provided the authorized travel is 45 miles or more from the traveler's home. We will directly pay for lodging bills, and there will be no need for employees to expense lodging charges. However, during check-in, employees are required to provide a credit card for any incidental expenses.

### Food and Beverages

TEN7 will reimburse up to $25 per meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner — up to a maximum of $75 per day) for food and beverages if your travel falls over a regular meal time. In the case one employee covers the meal cost for one or more employees, the daily limit per employee must not be exceeded, and the employee must list all employee names included in the meal cost. Original receipts are required.

### Travel for Non-Employees

Additional costs for travel, lodging, meal or other travel expenses for spouses or other family members will not be reimbursed unless the individual has a bona fide company purpose for engaging in the travel or attending the event.
