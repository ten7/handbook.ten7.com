[TEN7](https://ten7.com/) is a values driven web design and Drupal development agency whose mission is to [Make Things That Matter](https://ten7.com/mission). We provide strategy, design, development and support services and have deep expertise in Drupal. We value being on a team that is honest, inclusive, open and mindful. We promise to always lead with empathy.

We asked our team to share what they would go back and tell themselves as a new hire at TEN7. Here is what a few of us said:

* “Be confident, you know more than you think you do.”
* “Don’t stress too hard about everything being perfect.”
* “Don’t be afraid to ask for help. We’re a team, and everyone really does want to help!”
* “The TEN7 team is open, and we want to hear what you have to say.”


## Our Company

We're all brand ambassadors for TEN7. You can always find our brand guidelines at [https://t7.io/brandguidelines](https://t7.io/brandguidelines). Since you might be writing about our company, please note a few things. 

### Writing Our Company Name

You can write our company's name in many different ways—but there are a few that are preferred over others.
It's correct to write:

* TEN7
* T7 -- for short
* ten7.com -- any reference that includes the domain, lowercase

The rule of thumb is that "TEN7" should always be written in CAPS with NO space between the "TEN" and the number "7"—please don’t use lowercase, and don’t add spaces. The "TEN7" wordmark is geared to resemble the logo as closely as possible.

Exception: Our company’s legal name is **Ten 7 Interactive, LLC**., but this will only be used on legal documents like signed contracts. Ivan talks about our company’s origin in episode 21 of our podcast “TEN7’s Origins” at [https://t7.io/ep21](https://t7.io/ep21).
