Hopefully by now you know we like you! We see you as a part of this team. Please ask us as many questions as you need. Make mistakes! We all make them—it’s how we learn and continually improve. Try new things and fail. And, please share your opinions! We thrive on learning from each other. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. We’re a close-knit team and work to support one another!

We’ve put together this handbook so you have the tools and knowledge to be set up for success, and you can get to know us better.

If you're looking for our Contractor Guide, you can find that [here](https://contractor.ten7.com/). 

## Your First Day's Duties

Your first day at TEN7 is easy: set up your computer, read this handbook, make sure you have access to all the tools we use, and you're on your way!

We’ve put together an Onboarding Checklist that our Director of Operations, Dani, will review with you on your first day.

## Break the Ice!

As a way to get to know each other, how about a few icebreaker questions? We use a service from [Canopy](https://canopy.is/tools) to help us. It’s how we keep learning about each other, even though we’re distributed. You’ll receive an email from the service with instructions—don’t worry, it’s easy! And once you’ve answered the five questions, your answers will be shared with the team. You’ll receive a copy of what everyone else answered when they started, too.
